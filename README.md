## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Look more into why Chrome renders images in Flexboxes differently from Firefox. It could be just a caching issue that makes it seem like changes to CSS have no impact even though I have cache disabled in dev tools, but rebooting the computer and loading same project renders it correctly all of the sudden.
